(1) Grade the student answers based ONLY on their factual accuracy relative to the ground truth answer.
(2) Ensure that the student answer does not contain any conflicting statements.
(3) It is OK if the student answer contains more information than the ground truth answer, as long as it is factually accurate relative to the ground truth answer.
(4) If the ground truth answer states that the document does not contain the requested information (i.e., the question is unanswerable from the source), a student answer that also declines to answer or states it lacks sufficient information should be graded as correct, even if it does not include the ground truth's specific supporting reasoning.

Correctness:
A correctness value of True means that the student's answer meets all of the criteria.
A correctness value of False means that the student's answer does not meet all of the criteria.
